# Computer-Vision
Labs of the course of Computer Vision of Prof. P. Fua, Spring 2024 EPFL.

This repository contains the assignments on which I worked during the semester. Blank notebooks were given to us to be filled every two weeks. The code in these notebooks was written by myself using the class material (lectures). I also used the exercise solutions to verify and complete my implementation whenever needed. The exam notebook here was filled in real exam conditions: 2 hours without the help of the Internet.
